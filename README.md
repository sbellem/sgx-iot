# Key Provisioning, Secure Signing, and Verifiable Remote Attestation using IntelÂ® SGX
This is an adaptation of the original code sample found at
https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/code-sample-gateway-key-provisioning-and-secure-signing-using-intel-software-guard.html.
For convenience, the original code is also under the branch
[`download`](https://github.com/sbellem/sgx-iot/tree/download).

The focus of this adaptation is on combining the key generation with remote
attestation such that the public key is included in the report data of a remote
attestation report. Moreover the code samples demonstrate how the remote attestation
verification report can be used to verify the reported MRENCLAVE against the trusted
source code, using a docker & nix -based toolchain, managed by a small tool named
[`auditee`](https://auditee.readthedocs.io).

## Prerequisites
* You need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (version 19.03+) and
  [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

* The docker-based development environment assumes it is running on an SGX-enabled
  processor. If you are not sure whether your computer supports SGX, and/or how to
  enable it, see https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware#test-sgx.

* Obtain an **Unlinkable** subscription key for the
  [Intel SGX Attestation Service Utilizing Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID)](https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/).


## Quickstart

### Set Environment Variables
Before starting a container, set the two following environment variables:

* `SGX_SPID` - used to create a quote
* `IAS_PRIMARY_KEY` - used to access Intel's Attestation Service (IAS)

```shell
export SGX_SPID=<your-SPID>
export IAS_PRIMARY_KEY=<your-ias-primary-key>
```

### Run the demo
The demo creates an asymmetric elliptic curve keypair. It seals both the private key and
public key. The public key is sealed to protect it against tampering as it is included
in the attestation report from which a quote is generated, and can be verified by
sending it to Intel's Attestation Service. Upon a successful verification of the
quote, the client checks that the MRENCLAVE contained in the reoprt matches that of
the trusted source code. That is, when re-building the enclave from source, its
MRENCLAVE is the trusted reference. If the MRENCLAVE matches the client extracts
the public key out of the report data, and uses that public key to verify the signature
generated by the enclave. If the signature is valid, the client can trust the sensor
data.

```shell
$ docker-compose run --rm sgxiot ./run_demo_sgxra.sh
```

The sections below, provide some details about some key steps of the demo.

### Send the quote to Intel
Go into an ipython shell:

```shell
ipython
```

Copy the quote from the output, and assign it to a variable:

```python
quote = {
    "isvEnclaveQuote":"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"
}
```

To send the quote over to Intel, you need your API primary subscription key,
which you should have set as an environment variable before starting the
container. (See the prerequisite section if needed.)

```python
import os

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': os.environ["IAS_PRIMARY_KEY"],
}
```

send the quote for verification:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.trustedservices.intel.com/sgx/dev/attestation/v4/report'

res = requests.post(url, json=quote, headers=headers)
```

If everything went well the `res.status_code` should be 200, or
`res.ok` `True`. You can look at `res.reason` for more information if you
got an error.

```python
In [6]: res.json()
Out[6]:

```

With the above output, it's possible to check the MRENCLAVE, etc, and to
extract the public key out of the report data.

**NOTE:** The `res.headers` are important to check signature and certificates
to make sure the report is authentic, meaning that it was signed by Intel's
key.

### Verify the MRENCLAVE
**TODO**

### Extract the Public Key
From the json of the response, we get the quote body, encoded in base 64.

```python
quote_body = res.json()['isvEnclaveQuoteBody']
```

In order to extract the report data out of the quote, it's necessary to be
aware of the structure of a quote (`sgx_quote_t`) and of a report
(`sgx_report_body_t`).

```C
typedef struct _quote_t
{
    uint16_t            version;        /* 0   */
    uint16_t            sign_type;      /* 2   */
    sgx_epid_group_id_t epid_group_id;  /* 4   */
    sgx_isv_svn_t       qe_svn;         /* 8   */
    sgx_isv_svn_t       pce_svn;        /* 10  */
    uint32_t            xeid;           /* 12  */
    sgx_basename_t      basename;       /* 16  */
    sgx_report_body_t   report_body;    /* 48  */
    uint32_t            signature_len;  /* 432 */
    uint8_t             signature[];    /* 436 */
} sgx_quote_t;
```

The repport data is at the end of the `report_body`, at offset 320:

```C
typedef struct _report_body_t
{
    sgx_cpu_svn_t           cpu_svn;        /* (  0) Security Version of the CPU */
    sgx_misc_select_t       misc_select;    /* ( 16) Which fields defined in SSA.MISC */
    uint8_t                 reserved1[SGX_REPORT_BODY_RESERVED1_BYTES];  /* ( 20) */
    sgx_isvext_prod_id_t    isv_ext_prod_id;/* ( 32) ISV assigned Extended Product ID */
    sgx_attributes_t        attributes;     /* ( 48) Any special Capabilities the Enclave possess */
    sgx_measurement_t       mr_enclave;     /* ( 64) The value of the enclave's ENCLAVE measurement */
    uint8_t                 reserved2[SGX_REPORT_BODY_RESERVED2_BYTES];  /* ( 96) */
    sgx_measurement_t       mr_signer;      /* (128) The value of the enclave's SIGNER measurement */
    uint8_t                 reserved3[SGX_REPORT_BODY_RESERVED3_BYTES];  /* (160) */
    sgx_config_id_t         config_id;      /* (192) CONFIGID */
    sgx_prod_id_t           isv_prod_id;    /* (256) Product ID of the Enclave */
    sgx_isv_svn_t           isv_svn;        /* (258) Security Version of the Enclave */
    sgx_config_svn_t        config_svn;     /* (260) CONFIGSVN */
    uint8_t                 reserved4[SGX_REPORT_BODY_RESERVED4_BYTES];  /* (262) */
    sgx_isvfamily_id_t      isv_family_id;  /* (304) ISV assigned Family ID */
    sgx_report_data_t       report_data;    /* (320) Data provided by the user */
} sgx_report_body_t;
```

With the above information, we can decode the base 64 encoded quote, and
access the report data in it.

```python
import base64

report_data = base64.b64decode(quote_body)[368:432]
```

The original demo wrote the public key in PEM format under the file
`demo_sgx/secp256r1.pem`. The public key we have in the report data should
match the one in the `.pem` file. We'll use Python's `cryptography` library to
verify this.

With Python's `cryptography` library, the public point can be used to
instantiate a public key object, `EllipticCurvePublicKey`, from which it's
possible to obtain other formats such as PEM and DER.

It's important to note that Python's cryptography library expects the point to
be encoded as per Section 2.3.3 in https://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf. The
report data contains both x and y coordinates, in uncompressed form, and
without the octet prefix `04`. It's therefore necessary to add the octet
prefix to the report data.

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ec

point = b"\x04" + report_data
pubkey = ec.EllipticCurvePublicKey.from_encoded_point(curve=ec.SECP256R1(), data=point)
```

Check that it matches the PEM data file:

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization

pem_from_report_data = pubkey.public_bytes(
    encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM,
    format=serialization.PublicFormat.SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
)

with open('demo_sgx/secp256r1.pem') as f:
    pem_file_data = f.read()

pem_from_report_data == pem_file_data.encode()
# True
```

### Verify the Signed Data
```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ec

with open('demo_sgx/Sensor_Data.signature', 'rb') as f:
    signature = f.read()

with open('Sensor_Data') as f:
    sensor_data = f.read()

pubkey.verify(
    signature,
    sensor_data.encode(),
    signature_algorithm=ec.ECDSA(hashes.SHA256()),
)
```
